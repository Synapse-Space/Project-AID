# Contributing to Project-AID

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Project-AID as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/your-username/Project-AID/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happened
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces for JavaScript/JSON, 4 spaces for Python.
- **Quotes**: Single quotes for JavaScript strings, double quotes for JSON and Python.
- **Semicolons**: Always use semicolons in JavaScript.
